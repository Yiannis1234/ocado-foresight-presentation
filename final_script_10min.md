### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
"Good morning. I am **[Name]**, Chief Strategy Officer.

**Simply put: We are a technology company. We sell the Ocado Smart Platform (OSP).**

**This is not just robots. It is an end-to-end system: The website, the AI routing, and the automated warehouses.**

For ten years, our value has come from these 'Giant Hives'—centralized warehouses where robots swarm to pack food.

But today, I will show you why this 'Giant Warehouse' model is becoming old-fashioned. I will present a new plan to move from 'Giant Buildings' to 'Local Networks'."

### **Slide 2: Introduction**
"Let's look at **Slide 2**.

Ocado is at a turning point.
Right now, we build **Centralized Networks**. We build massive hives 50 miles away from the city.

Look at the **'Tech Check'** on the screen.
Our main tool is the robotic arm (Figure 1). It uses a **suction cup** to grab items.
It works great for rigid boxes.
But it has a **'Handling Problem'**. The suction cup fails on soft, irregular shapes like a bag of oranges. It is too clumsy.
Because of this, we still have to pay humans to pack delicate items. This is expensive.

Today I will cover:
1.  **Market:** Why the 'Giant Warehouse' is losing money.
2.  **Tech Check:** Why our machines don't fit in cities.
3.  **Strategy:** How we must change."

### **Slide 3: Market Forces**
"On **Slide 3**, we see the five forces squeezing our business (PESTEL Analysis).

First, **Political**:
Cities like London have introduced **'Green Zones' (ULEZ)**. They charge us £12.50 every day for every diesel van. For a fleet of 2,000 vans, this costs us **£9 million a year** in taxes.

Second, **Economic**:
Interest rates are high (5%). Building a £250m warehouse is now too expensive. We cannot afford to borrow money when debt is this expensive.

Third, **Social**:
Customers have changed. They want delivery in **one hour**, not next-day. A warehouse on the M25 highway simply cannot physically reach a customer in Chelsea in 60 minutes. We are too far away.

Fourth, **Technological**:
**AI Vision is the game changer.** It allows robots to 'see' delicate fruit, solving our handling problem. This technology finally exists today (e.g., Google's RT-2 model).

Fifth, **Legal**:
New employment laws (like the **Uber Ruling**) mean we can no longer rely on cheap 'gig-economy' drivers. We must hire full employees with pensions, which increases our labor cost by **20%**.

Conclusion: The 'Giant Warehouse' model is being killed by Taxes, Interest Rates, and Labor Laws."

### **Slide 4: Architecture**
"To understand the problem, look at our Architecture on **Slide 4**.

Currently, our system is a straight line: Order → Brain → Hive → Van.
The 'Hive' is a **Giant Block**.
It needs a perfectly flat floor. You cannot make it smaller. You cannot put it in a basement.
This forces us to build far away from the customer."

### **Slide 5: Critical Limitations**
"This leads to the three problems you see on **Slide 5**.

**Point 1: Too Heavy for City Shops.**
Our grid weighs 2 tons per square meter. If we put this in a normal building, it would crash through the floor.

**Point 2: Clumsy Robots.**
As I said, our robots crush strawberries. This means we still need human workers, which kills our profit.

**Point 3: High Energy Cost.**
A giant hive gets very hot. We spend millions cooling it down.

**The result:** Our machines are too big, too heavy, and too clumsy for the future city."

### **Slide 6: Future Planning**
"So, we have a choice. Look at **Slide 6**.

To map this out scientifically, we used **Peter Schwartz's Scenario Planning Methodology**.
We identified two 'Critical Uncertainties':
1.  **AI Capability:** Will robots get smart enough to handle chaos?
2.  **Network Topology:** Will the future be Centralized or Decentralized?

This creates our 2x2 Matrix (shown as a tree here).
1.  **Path 1 (Top):** We keep building Giant Warehouses.
2.  **Path 2 (Bottom):** We use AI to go Local.

**How does AI help?**
AI allows robots to work in messy environments. They don't need a perfect grid anymore. They can see and adapt.
This unlocks **Path 2: The Local Mesh**."

### **Slide 7: Scenario 1 - The Trap**
"Let's look at **Slide 7: The 'Giant Warehouse' Trap**.

This is what happens if we don't use AI to change.
We build a massive building that lasts 50 years.
But shopping habits change every 5 years.
If everyone switches to 'Instant Delivery', our giant warehouse becomes a **'Useless Building'**. It is in the wrong place, and we can't move it.

Also, look at the **'Risk of Failure'**. If one giant warehouse has a fire, we lose food supply for the whole region. It is too risky."

### **Slide 8: Scenario 2 - The Local Mesh**
"Now, look at **Slide 8**. This is our recommended future: **The Local Mesh**.

Instead of one giant hub, we look at **'High Street Voids'** (Empty Shops).
**14% of shops are empty.**
Because our new AI robots are smart and gentle, we can put them inside these small, messy shops.

This allows **Green Delivery**.
Because we are close to the customer, we can deliver by bike or on foot.
No more vans. No more traffic taxes."

### **Slide 9: Recommendations**
"To make this happen, I have a 3-step plan on **Slide 9**.

**1. Immediate Action (The Blue Layer):**
**Stop Building Giant Hubs.** We must stop spending money on new giant warehouses today.

**2. New Research Goal (The Green Layer):**
Focus on **'AI Vision & Soft Hands'**. We need to teach our robots to see and hold delicate food so they can work in old shops.

**3. New Business Plan (The Orange Layer):**
We stop being a construction company.
Instead, we sell **'The Brain'** (our AI Software). We license our AI to supermarkets so they can run their own local robot networks."

### **Slide 10: Summary**
"To summarize on **Slide 10**:

1.  **Market:** Taxes and Costs are killing the Big Warehouse model.
2.  **Tech:** AI allows us to move from rigid grids to flexible, local robots.
3.  **Vision:** We must become a 'Smart Logistics' company, selling the AI Brain, not the steel Warehouse.

Thank you. I am happy to take questions."
