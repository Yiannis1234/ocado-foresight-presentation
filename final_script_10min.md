**Time Limit:** 10 Minutes
**Tone:** Simple, Clear, Direct.

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
"Good morning. I am **[Name]**, Chief Strategy Officer.

**Simply put: We are the company that builds the robots that pack groceries.**

For ten years, we have been famous for the **Ocado Smart Platform**—those giant warehouses where robots swarm to pack food.

But today, I will show you why this 'Giant Warehouse' model is becoming old-fashioned. I will present a new plan to move from 'Giant Buildings' to 'Local Networks'."

### **Slide 2: Introduction**
"Let's look at **Slide 2**.

Ocado is at a turning point.
Right now, we build **Centralized Networks**. We build massive hives 50 miles away from the city.

Look at the **'Tech Check'** on the screen.
Our main tool is the robotic arm (Figure 1). It works great for boxes.
But it has a **'Handling Problem'**. It is too clumsy. It crushes soft fruit.
Because of this, we still have to pay humans to pack delicate items. This is expensive.

Today I will cover:
1.  **Market:** Why the 'Giant Warehouse' is losing money.
2.  **Tech Check:** Why our machines don't fit in cities.
3.  **Strategy:** How we must change."

### **Slide 3: Market Forces**
"On **Slide 3**, we see the three forces squeezing our business.

First, **Political (The Gavel icon)**:
Cities like London have introduced 'Green Zones' (ULEZ). They charge us £12.50 every day for every diesel van. This costs us millions in taxes.

Second, **Economic (The Money icon)**:
Interest rates are high (5%). Building a £250m warehouse is now too expensive. We cannot afford to borrow that much money anymore.

Third, **Social (The People icon)**:
Customers have changed. They want delivery in **one hour**, not next-day. A warehouse on the highway cannot reach a customer in Chelsea in 60 minutes.

Conclusion: The 'Giant Warehouse' is too expensive and too slow."

### **Slide 4: Architecture**
"To solve this, look at our Architecture on **Slide 4**.

Currently, our system is a straight line: Order → Brain → Hive → Van.
The 'Hive' is a **Giant Block**.
It needs a perfectly flat floor. You cannot make it smaller. You cannot put it in a basement.
This forces us to build far away from the customer."

### **Slide 5: Critical Limitations**
"This leads to the three problems you see on **Slide 5**.

**Point 1: Too Heavy for City Shops.**
Our grid weighs 2 tons per square meter. If we put this in a normal building, it would crash through the floor.

**Point 2: Clumsy Robots.**
As I said, our robots crush strawberries. This means we still need human workers, which kills our profit.

**Point 3: High Energy Cost.**
A giant hive gets very hot. We spend millions cooling it down.

**The result:** Our machines are too big, too heavy, and too clumsy for the future city."

### **Slide 6: Future Planning**
"So, we have a choice. Look at **Slide 6**.

We used 'Scenario Planning' to see two different futures.
1.  **Path 1 (Top):** We keep building Giant Warehouses.
2.  **Path 2 (Bottom):** We use AI to go Local.

If we stay on Path 1, we fall into a Trap.
If we choose Path 2, we build a 'Local Mesh'."

### **Slide 7: Scenario 1 - The Trap**
"Let's look at **Slide 7: The 'Giant Warehouse' Trap**.

This is what happens if we don't change.
We build a massive building that lasts 50 years.
But shopping habits change every 5 years.
If everyone switches to 'Instant Delivery', our giant warehouse becomes a **'Useless Building'**. It is in the wrong place, and we can't move it.

Also, look at the **'Risk of Failure'**. If one giant warehouse has a fire, we lose food supply for the whole region. It is too risky."

### **Slide 8: Scenario 2 - The Local Mesh**
"Now, look at **Slide 8**. This is our recommended future: **The Local Mesh**.

Instead of one giant hub, we look at **'High Street Voids'** (Empty Shops).
**14% of shops are empty.**
We can put small, smart robots inside these empty shops.

This allows **Green Delivery**.
Because we are close to the customer, we can deliver by bike or on foot.
No more vans. No more traffic taxes."

### **Slide 9: Recommendations**
"To make this happen, I have a 3-step plan on **Slide 9**.

**1. Immediate Action (The Blue Layer):**
**Stop Building Giant Hubs.** We must stop spending money on new giant warehouses today.

**2. New Research Goal (The Green Layer):**
Focus on **'Soft Robotics'**. We need to invent robots that are gentle with fruit and can work in old, messy buildings.

**3. New Business Plan (The Orange Layer):**
We stop being a construction company.
Instead, we sell **'The Brain'** (our Software). We license our technology to supermarkets so they can upgrade *their* stores, rather than building our own."

### **Slide 10: Summary**
"To summarize on **Slide 10**:

1.  **Market:** Taxes and Costs are killing the Big Warehouse model.
2.  **Tech:** We need flexible robots that fit in cities.
3.  **Vision:** We must become a 'Smart Logistics' company, not a 'Warehouse Builder'.

Thank you. I am happy to take questions."
