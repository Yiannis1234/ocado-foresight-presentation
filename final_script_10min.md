# Final Board Presentation Script: Ocado 2035 Strategy
**Time Limit:** 10 Minutes Strict
**Speaker:** [Your Name], Chief Strategy Officer
**Audience:** Board of Directors

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
**(Duration: 0:00 - 0:45 | 45 Seconds)**

"Good morning, members of the Board. My name is **[State Your Name]**, and I am the Chief Strategy Officer.

**Simply put: We are the company that builds the robots that pack online groceries.**

For the last decade, our valuation has been driven by the **Ocado Smart Platform (OSP)**—those massive robotic hives that automate food fulfillment. We are the undisputed leaders in this centralized model.

However, my analysis of the 2035 horizon suggests this model is becoming obsolete. Today, I will present a foresight strategy arguing for a radical pivot: we must move from 'Mega-Infrastructure' to 'Distributed Intelligence'."

### **Slide 2: Introduction**
**(Duration: 0:45 - 1:30 | 45 Seconds)**

"Let's ground this in our current reality. **What is Ocado today?**

We operate a **Centralized Network**. We build massive automated hives where robots swarm on a grid to pick groceries, which we then truck 50 miles to the customer.

As detailed in our **2023 Annual Report**, this 'Grid and Arm' architecture (Figure 1) creates incredibly high pick-rates for rigid packaging.

But it has a fatal flaw: **Dexterity.** As noted by **Smith (2022) in the Journal of Robotics**, rigid manipulators cannot handle soft produce without bruising it. This leaves us reliant on expensive human labor for 20% of the basket.

My presentation today covers three areas:
1.  **Market Forces:** The external pressures killing this 'Big Box' model.
2.  **Tech Audit:** The hidden fragility in our grid.
3.  **The Pivot:** A roadmap to the 'Local Mesh'."

### **Slide 3: Market Forces (PESTEL)**
**(Duration: 1:30 - 2:45 | 75 Seconds)**

"Using the **PESTEL Framework**, we isolated the macro-drivers forcing this change.

First, **Economic**: The era of cheap capital is dead. With base interest rates holding at 5%, the **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** for building a £250m Customer Fulfillment Center has doubled since 2021. We simply cannot afford to build 'Mega-Sheds' anymore.

Second, **Political**: The expansion of **ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zones)** in London and Paris places a £12.50 daily tax on every diesel van. For a centralized fleet of 2,000 vans, this is a multi-million pound operational penalty.

Third, **Social**: The customer has shifted to **'Q-Commerce'**. As identified by **Deloitte (2024)**, 40% of urban consumers now expect delivery in under 60 minutes. A warehouse on the M25 motorway physically cannot service a customer in Chelsea that fast.

We are being squeezed by **Cost, Compliance, and Convenience**."

### **Slide 4: OSP Architecture**
**(Duration: 2:45 - 3:30 | 45 Seconds)**

"To solve this, we must look at our architecture.

Currently, OSP is a linear system: Order → Brain → Hive → Van.
The 'Hive' is a marvel of swarm robotics. But functionally, it is a **Monolith**.
It requires a perfectly flat, custom-built floor. It cannot scale down. You cannot put a Hive in a basement. This architecture forces us into a 'Centralized' strategy, whether we like it or not."

### **Slide 5: Critical Limitations**
**(Duration: 3:30 - 4:30 | 60 Seconds)**

"This leads to **three** critical engineering bottlenecks shown in Figure 2.

First: **Infrastructure Rigidity.** The grid imposes a floor load of 2 tons per square meter. This rules out 95% of existing urban real estate.

Second: **The Dexterity Gap.** As I touched on earlier, robots still crush soft fruit. This keeps expensive human labor in the loop, killing our unit economics.

Third: **Energy Intensity.** A standard Hive consumes megawatt-levels of power for cooling. In a volatile UK energy market, this high-consumption model is a significant financial risk.

If the future is urban, our hardware physically cannot fit there."

### **Slide 6: Foresight Methodology (Tree)**
**(Duration: 4:30 - 5:30 | 60 Seconds)**

"To navigate this, we applied **Schwartz's Scenario Planning Methodology**. We mapped two critical uncertainties:
1.  **AI Capability:** Will computer vision solve the dexterity gap?
2.  **Network Topology:** Will logistics stay centralized or go distributed?

This creates the Decision Tree you see here.
We are currently at 'Status Quo'.
If we ignore the market and stay **Centralized**, we drift into **Scenario 1: The Mega-Hive**.
If we leverage AI to go **Decentralized**, we unlock **Scenario 2: The Local Mesh**."

### **Slide 7: Scenario 1 - The "Monolith" Trap**
**(Duration: 5:30 - 6:45 | 75 Seconds)**

"Let's critically critique Scenario 1. This is 'business as usual'. We build fewer, larger automated warehouses.

While efficient on paper, this creates a **'Stranded Asset' risk**.
We are pouring concrete for a 50-year asset lifespan. But the retail market cycles every 5-7 years. If consumer demand shifts entirely to 'instant' delivery, these massive sheds on the M25 become useless monuments.

Furthermore, it creates a **Single Point of Failure**. As seen in the Andover fire, losing one node paralyzes an entire region. This is a fragile strategy."

### **Slide 8: Scenario 2 - The "Local Mesh"**
**(Duration: 6:45 - 8:00 | 75 Seconds)**

"Contrast this with Scenario 2: **The Local Mesh**. This is our recommended future.

Instead of one giant hub, we utilize 'High Street Voids'.
Data from the **British Retail Consortium** indicates a 14% vacancy rate on high streets. We can retrofit these empty units with modular, soft-robotics systems.

This enables **Green Delivery**. By being located *within* the community, we replace diesel vans with cargo bikes and walkers. This insulates us from carbon taxes and aligns with the **UK Government's Net Zero Strategy**."

### **Slide 9: Recommendations**
**(Duration: 8:00 - 9:15 | 75 Seconds)**

"To execute this, I propose a three-phase Strategic Roadmap.

**Phase 1 (2025): Stop.** We must halt CapEx on new Mega-CFCs immediately.

**Phase 2 (2026): Retrofit.** We divert R&D spend into **'Soft Robotics'**—machines that can operate in irregular, brownfield sites—and launch pilots in vacant retail units.

**Phase 3 (2030): Unbundle.** This is the key strategic pivot. Currently, we sell 'The Shed' (Hardware). We must transition to selling 'The Brain' (Software). We should license our logistics AI to retailers to run *their own* local meshes, transforming Ocado into a high-margin SaaS platform rather than a construction company."

### **Slide 10: Executive Summary**
**(Duration: 9:15 - 10:00 | 45 Seconds)**

"In conclusion:

1.  **Market:** The economic drivers (Interest Rates, Green Taxes) are making the Mega-Warehouse model unviable.
2.  **Technology:** We must pivot from 'Rigid Grids' to 'Flexible Mesh' robotics.
3.  **Vision:** By 2035, Ocado should not be defined by the warehouses we build, but by the intelligence that connects them.

Thank you. I will now take questions on the financials of the retrofit strategy."
