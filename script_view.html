        <div class="slide-title">Slide 1: Title Slide</div>
        <p>"Good morning. I am <strong>[Name]</strong>, Chief Strategy Officer.</p>
        <p><strong>Simply put: We are a technology company. We sell the Ocado Smart Platform (OSP).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>This is not just robots. It is an end-to-end system: The website, the AI routing, and the automated warehouses.</strong></p>
        <p>For ten years, our value has come from these 'Giant Hives'—centralized warehouses where robots swarm to pack food.</p>
        <p>But today, I will show you why this 'Giant Warehouse' model is becoming old-fashioned. I will present a new plan to move from 'Giant Buildings' to 'Local Networks'."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 2: Introduction</div>
        <p>"Let's look at <strong>Slide 2</strong>.</p>
        <p>Ocado is at a turning point. Right now, we build <strong>Centralized Networks</strong>. We build massive hives 50 miles away from the city.</p>
        <p>Look at the <strong>'Tech Check'</strong> on the screen.<br>
        Our main tool is the robotic arm (Figure 1). It uses a <strong>suction cup</strong> to grab items.<br>
        It works great for rigid boxes.<br>
        But it has a <strong>'Handling Problem'</strong>. The suction cup fails on soft, irregular shapes like a bag of oranges. It is too clumsy.<br>
        Because of this, we still have to pay humans to pack delicate items. This is expensive.</p>
        <p>Today I will cover:<br>
        1. <strong>Market:</strong> Why the 'Giant Warehouse' is losing money.<br>
        2. <strong>Tech Check:</strong> Why our machines don't fit in cities.<br>
        3. <strong>Strategy:</strong> How we must change."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 3: Market Forces</div>
        <p>"On <strong>Slide 3</strong>, we see the five forces squeezing our business (PESTEL Analysis).</p>
        <p>First, <strong>Political</strong>:<br>
        Cities like London have introduced <strong>'Green Zones' (ULEZ)</strong>. They charge us £12.50 every day for every diesel van. For a fleet of 2,000 vans, this costs us <strong>£9 million a year</strong> in taxes.</p>
        <p>Second, <strong>Economic</strong>:<br>
        Interest rates are high (5%). Building a £250m warehouse is now too expensive. We cannot afford to borrow money when debt is this expensive.</p>
        <p>Third, <strong>Social</strong>:<br>
        Customers have changed. They want delivery in <strong>one hour</strong>, not next-day. A warehouse on the M25 motorway simply cannot physically reach a customer in Chelsea in 60 minutes. We are too far away.</p>
        <p>Fourth, <strong>Technological</strong>:<br>
        <strong>AI Vision is the game changer.</strong> It allows robots to 'see' delicate fruit, solving our handling problem. This technology finally exists today (e.g., Google's RT-2 model).</p>
        <p>Fifth, <strong>Legal</strong>:<br>
        New employment laws (like the <strong>Uber Ruling</strong>) mean we can no longer rely on cheap 'gig-economy' drivers. We must hire full employees with pensions, which increases our labor cost by <strong>20%</strong>.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: The 'Giant Warehouse' model is being killed by Taxes, Interest Rates, and Labor Laws."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 4: Architecture</div>
        <p>"To understand the problem, look at our Architecture on <strong>Slide 4</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is the <strong>'Hive' Grid System</strong>.<br>
        It is a dense 3D grid where robots swarm on top to dig for bins.<br>
        The process is a rigid straight line (as shown in the diagram):<br>
        1. <strong>Customer Order</strong> comes in.<br>
        2. <strong>The Brain</strong> (AI) plans the route.<br>
        3. <strong>The Hive</strong> robots pick the food.<br>
        4. <strong>Delivery</strong> vans drive 50 miles to the home.</p>
        <p>The problem? The 'Hive' is a <strong>Giant Block</strong>.<br>
        It needs a perfectly flat floor. You cannot make it smaller. You cannot put it in a basement.<br>
        This forces us to build far away from the customer."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 5: Critical Limitations</div>
        <p>"This leads to the three problems you see on <strong>Slide 5</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 1: Too Heavy for City Shops.</strong><br>
        Look at <strong>Figure 2</strong>. The massive 'Automated CFC' (Customer Fulfillment Center) on the right is our standard giant warehouse. It weighs 2 tons per square meter. It is simply too heavy to fit in the small city shops shown on the left.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 2: Clumsy Robots.</strong><br>
        As I said, our robots crush strawberries. This means we still need human workers, which kills our profit.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 3: High Energy Cost.</strong><br>
        A giant hive generates immense heat from thousands of motors. We spend millions on industrial cooling systems to keep it running.</p>
        <p><strong>The result:</strong> Our machines are too big, too heavy, and too clumsy for the future city."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 6: Future Planning</div>
        <p>"So, we have a choice. Look at <strong>Slide 6</strong>.</p>
        <p>To map this out scientifically, we used <strong>Peter Schwartz's Scenario Planning Methodology</strong>.<br>
        We identified two 'Critical Uncertainties':<br>
        1. <strong>AI Capability:</strong> Will robots get smart enough to handle chaos?<br>
        2. <strong>Network Topology:</strong> Will the future be Centralized or Decentralized?</p>
        <p>This creates our 2x2 Matrix (shown as a tree here).<br>
        1. <strong>Path 1 (Top):</strong> We keep building Giant Warehouses.<br>
        2. <strong>Path 2 (Bottom):</strong> We use AI to go Local.</p>
        <p><strong>How does AI help?</strong><br>
        AI Vision allows robots to "see" in messy environments. They don't need a perfect grid anymore. They can adapt to old shops.<br>
        This unlocks <strong>Path 2: The Local Mesh</strong>."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 7: Scenario 1 - The Trap</div>
        <p>"Let's look at <strong>Slide 7: The 'Giant Warehouse' Trap</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is what happens if we don't use AI to change.<br>
        We build a massive building that lasts 50 years.<br>
        But shopping habits change every 5 years.<br>
        If everyone switches to 'Instant Delivery', our giant warehouse becomes a <strong>'Useless Building'</strong>. It is in the wrong place, and we can't move it.</p>
        <p>Also, look at the <strong>'Risk of Failure'</strong>. If one giant warehouse has a fire, we lose food supply for the whole region. It is too risky."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 8: Scenario 2 - The Local Mesh</div>
        <p>"Now, look at <strong>Slide 8</strong>. This is our recommended future: <strong>The Local Mesh</strong>.</p>
        <p>Instead of one giant hub, we look at <strong>'High Street Voids'</strong> (Empty Shops).<br>
        <strong>14% of shops are empty.</strong><br>
        Because our new AI robots are smart and gentle, we can put them inside these small, messy shops.</p>
        <p>This allows <strong>Green Delivery</strong>.<br>
        Because we are close to the customer, we can deliver by bike or on foot.<br>
        No more vans. No more traffic taxes."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 9: Recommendations</div>
        <p>"To make this happen, I have a 3-step plan on <strong>Slide 9</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Immediate Action (The Blue Layer):</strong><br>
        <strong>Stop Building Giant Hubs.</strong> We must stop spending money on new giant warehouses today.</p>
        <p><strong>2. New Research Goal (The Green Layer):</strong><br>
        Solve the <strong>"Clumsy Robot"</strong> problem. Shift R&D to <strong>AI Vision & Soft Hands</strong> to handle delicate food without humans.</p>
        <p><strong>3. New Business Plan (The Orange Layer):</strong><br>
        We stop being a construction company.<br>
        Instead, we sell <strong>'The Brain'</strong> (our AI Software). We license our AI to retailers so they can run their own local robot networks."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 10: Summary</div>
        <p>"To summarize on <strong>Slide 10</strong>:</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Market:</strong> Taxes and Costs are killing the Big Warehouse model.<br>
        2. <strong>Tech:</strong> AI allows us to move from rigid grids to flexible, local robots.<br>
        3. <strong>Vision:</strong> We must become a 'Smart Logistics' company, selling the AI Brain, not the steel Warehouse.</p>
        <p>Thank you. I am happy to take questions."</p>
