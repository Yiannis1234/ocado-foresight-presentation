        <div class="slide-title">Slide 1: Title Slide</div>
        <p>"Good morning. I am <strong>[Name]</strong>, Chief Strategy Officer.</p>
        <p><strong>Simply put: We are the company that builds the robots that pack groceries.</strong></p>
        <p>For ten years, we have been famous for the <strong>Ocado Smart Platform</strong>—those giant warehouses where robots swarm to pack food.</p>
        <p>But today, I will show you why this 'Giant Warehouse' model is becoming old-fashioned. I will present a new plan to move from 'Giant Buildings' to 'Local Networks'."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 2: Introduction</div>
        <p>"Let's look at <strong>Slide 2</strong>.</p>
        <p>Ocado is at a turning point. Right now, we build <strong>Centralized Networks</strong>. We build massive hives 50 miles away from the city.</p>
        <p>Look at the <strong>'Tech Check'</strong> on the screen.<br>
        Our main tool is the robotic arm (Figure 1). It works great for boxes.<br>
        But it has a <strong>'Dexterity Problem'</strong>. It is too clumsy. It crushes soft fruit.<br>
        Because of this, we still have to pay humans to pack delicate items. This is expensive.</p>
        <p>Today I will cover:<br>
        1. <strong>Market:</strong> Why the 'Giant Warehouse' is losing money.<br>
        2. <strong>Tech Check:</strong> Why our machines don't fit in cities.<br>
        3. <strong>Strategy:</strong> How we must change."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 3: Market Forces</div>
        <p>"On <strong>Slide 3</strong>, we see the three forces squeezing our business.</p>
        <p>First, <strong>Political (The Gavel icon)</strong>:<br>
        Cities like London have introduced 'Green Zones' (ULEZ). They charge us £12.50 every day for every diesel van. This costs us millions in taxes.</p>
        <p>Second, <strong>Economic (The Money icon)</strong>:<br>
        Interest rates are high (5%). Building a £250m warehouse is now too expensive. We cannot afford to borrow that much money anymore.</p>
        <p>Third, <strong>Social (The People icon)</strong>:<br>
        Customers have changed. They want delivery in <strong>one hour</strong>, not next-day. A warehouse on the highway cannot reach a customer in Chelsea in 60 minutes.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: The 'Giant Warehouse' is too expensive and too slow."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 4: Architecture</div>
        <p>"To solve this, look at our Architecture on <strong>Slide 4</strong>.</p>
        <p>Currently, our system is a straight line: Order → Brain → Hive → Van.<br>
        The 'Hive' is a <strong>Giant Block</strong>.<br>
        It needs a perfectly flat floor. You cannot make it smaller. You cannot put it in a basement.<br>
        This forces us to build far away from the customer."</p>
        <span class="instruction">[CLICK TO NEXT SLIDE]</span>
    </div>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 5: Critical Limitations</div>
        <p>"This leads to the three problems you see on <strong>Slide 5</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 1: Too Heavy for City Shops.</strong><br>
        Our grid weighs 2 tons per square meter. If we put this in a normal building, it would crash through the floor.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 2: Clumsy Robots.</strong><br>
        As I said, our robots crush strawberries. This means we still need human workers, which kills our profit.</p>
        <p><strong>Point 3: High Energy Cost.</strong><br>
        A giant hive gets very hot. We spend millions cooling it down.</p>
        <p><strong>The result:</strong> Our machines are too big, too heavy, and too clumsy for the future city."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 6: Future Planning</div>
        <p>"So, we have a choice. Look at <strong>Slide 6</strong>.</p>
        <p>We used 'Scenario Planning' to see two different futures.<br>
        1. <strong>Path 1 (Top):</strong> We keep building Giant Warehouses.<br>
        2. <strong>Path 2 (Bottom):</strong> We use AI to go Local.</p>
        <p>If we stay on Path 1, we fall into a Trap.<br>
        If we choose Path 2, we build a 'Local Mesh'."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 7: Scenario 1 - The Trap</div>
        <p>"Let's look at <strong>Slide 7: The 'Giant Warehouse' Trap</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is what happens if we don't change.<br>
        We build a massive building that lasts 50 years.<br>
        But shopping habits change every 5 years.<br>
        If everyone switches to 'Instant Delivery', our giant warehouse becomes a <strong>'Useless Building'</strong>. It is in the wrong place, and we can't move it.</p>
        <p>Also, look at the <strong>'Risk of Failure'</strong>. If one giant warehouse has a fire, we lose food supply for the whole region. It is too risky."</p>

    </div>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 8: Scenario 2 - The Local Mesh</div>
        <p>"Now, look at <strong>Slide 8</strong>. This is our recommended future: <strong>The Local Mesh</strong>.</p>
        <p>Instead of one giant hub, we look at <strong>'High Street Voids'</strong> (Empty Shops).<br>
        <strong>14% of shops are empty.</strong><br>
        We can put small, smart robots inside these empty shops.</p>
        <p>This allows <strong>Green Delivery</strong>.<br>
        Because we are close to the customer, we can deliver by bike or on foot.<br>
        No more vans. No more traffic taxes."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 9: Recommendations</div>
        <p>"To make this happen, I have a 3-step plan on <strong>Slide 9</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Immediate Action (The Blue Layer):</strong><br>
        <strong>Stop Building Giant Hubs.</strong> We must stop spending money on new giant warehouses today.</p>
        <p><strong>2. New Research Goal (The Green Layer):</strong><br>
        Focus on <strong>'Soft Robotics'</strong>. We need to invent robots that are gentle with fruit and can work in old, messy buildings.</p>
        <p><strong>3. New Business Plan (The Orange Layer):</strong><br>
        We stop being a construction company.<br>
        Instead, we sell <strong>'The Brain'</strong> (our Software). We license our technology to supermarkets so they can run their own local networks."</p>

    <div class="slide-block">
        <div class="slide-title">Slide 10: Summary</div>
        <p>"To summarize on <strong>Slide 10</strong>:</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Market:</strong> Taxes and Costs are killing the Big Warehouse model.<br>
        2. <strong>Tech:</strong> We need flexible robots that fit in cities.<br>
        3. <strong>Vision:</strong> We must become a 'Smart Logistics' company, not a 'Warehouse Builder'.</p>
        <p>Thank you. I am happy to take questions."</p>
